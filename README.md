# Time-Dot
TimeDots is a minimalist mobile application that visualizes time as a grid of days. Each dot represents one day of the year, transforming abstract time into something visible, countable, and emotionally real. The app is designed to encourage awareness, intentional living, and a healthier relationship with time.
